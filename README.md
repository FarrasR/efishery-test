# efishery-test

Build the fetch API first, i use intellij to build it (its convenient). the auth api already built by dockerfile 

The database already included in the repo and the only thing you need to do is type docker-compose up.

This was made in a hurry in 3 days minus 20 hours so some parts of it could be better, but i think given the restriction and time limit i did well considering i only know kotlin 2 weeks ago
